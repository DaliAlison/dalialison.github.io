<p>Hi there!<br><br>

My name is Dali.<br>

I live in Las Vegas, NV since 2018. Before that I lived in San Diego, CA
for two years.<br>
I was born in Russia and moved to Sweden in 2001.<br>
I also lived in Bilbao, Spain from 2004 to 2007.<br>

I LOVE CATS!<br>
Photography has always been one of my biggest passions. <br>
I got my first camera as a birthday gift from my dad when I was 8. I still have it.<br><br> 

I have never used Jekyll and I am still learning how it works.
