Welcome to my website! I'm a current distance student at Linneaus University, Sweden. This website is a result of the first assignment. The goal was to create a website using Jekyll and work with CSS pre processor. 

I know that the design is a lot far from perfect, I will in the future correct that. As I get comfortable with SSG and Sass I plan to have a website for my personal photography projects.
