I have not had much experience with SSG, but from what I've heard and read, speed is the main characteristic of static. The entire website consists of static HTML files that are sitting on the server and waiting to be served to the user. The request is served back to the user almost instantly. Another good thing is that all your files are stored in a GitHub repository, so it is very cost effective. SSG is also very secure. Because all the development process is controlled locally and not on a web server, you can basically build your site on your computer and push the results to the web when you're done. You don't have to think about traffic issues because static HTML pages consume a very small amount of server resources.


What type of projects are they suitable for?

The most common use of SSG is to create a blog or a photographer portfolio for example.
If your project is based around delivering real-time(dynamic) information, then static is not a good choise. Static is static, and the information(the content) is the same for each visitor.
Another disadvantage is that there is no user input, so for example, to use comments, you have to rely on a third-party services like Disqus.

Static can be used for many different projects. For example, in 2012, Obama's presidentianl campaign used Jekyll to rise money. In 2013, Healthcare.gov(used for medical services in USA) switched to Jekyll as well. So SSG are not just limited to blogging. However, static is not for everyone, and will not solve all the problems. They are good in some cases and terrible in other. You have to judge for yourself if static is good for your project.
