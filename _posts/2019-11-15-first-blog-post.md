<p>I can not think of it in a positive or a negative way yet, since I am still trying to learn how it works. But what I noticed is that you have much more options and functionality, for example, you can use mixins and variables with Sass. For now, I still prefer the old style CSS, because it is just what I am used to. I dont't see a reason to change because the problems that Sass solves are not the problems I have with CSS. But Sass seems very interesting, and I hope to learn more of it.</p>
<ul>

<li>Compare to regular CSS</li>
<ul>
<li>Comparing to CSS, Sass offers the functionality of mixins, that can be written as a single row code to avoid repeating your CSS code. I can describe a mixin as an advanced "copy and paste". 
I also noticed that Sass uses functions that can be applied to colors in your CSS. When you create a variables for the color, you can manipulate it in many different ways. For example you can darken and lighten the color, saturate and disaturate the color, adjust hue, add transparency, tint and shade by adjusting the colors HSL.</li>
</ul>

<li>Which techniques did you use?</li>
<ul>
<li>I did not change the style sheets alot, since I don't have a lot of 
confidence. I redefined the defaults for some variables in _sass/minima.scss and other .scss files in the _sass folder. </li>
</ul>

<li>Pros and cons?</li>
<ul>
<li> A pro is that you don't need to repeat yourself, thus maintaining the DRY principle. Sass helps to keep the code organized and
makes the development process easier. A con is that if you don't have lots of programming skills besides CSS/HTML, it can take you a good while to learn. Debugging can also be a problem.</li>
</ul>
