I can not think of it in a positive or a negative way yet, since I am still trying to learn how it works. But what I noticed is that you have much more options and functionality, for example, you can use variables, mixins and variables with Sass. For now, I still prefer the old style CSS, because it is just what I am used to. But Sass seems very interesting, and I hope to learn more of it.
