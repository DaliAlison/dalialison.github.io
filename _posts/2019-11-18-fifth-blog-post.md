Because Jekyll is static, you have the disadvantage of not having any user input. This can be solved with a third-party service, like Disqus.
So, when you implement Disqus, the user can leave a comment. It is a good thing to have if your website is a blogging site.

Disqus is free. 
You first have to register an account at <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a>.
After that you can copy the source code snippets that Disqus provide and paste them into your code.
